									<h3>Rhys Gowman - Welsh Hockey</h3>
									<p>&quot;I came to see Jess after suffering an ACL rupture playing hockey which needed surgical intervention. I had a personal goal of competing in the Commonwealth Games in the Gold Coast which was 10 months after my surgery. I was very impressed with the support and guidance that I received throughout the duration of my rehabilitation. Jess provided me with hockey specific rehabilitation exercises which enabled me to return to hockey in time for the Commonwealth Games stronger and fitter than I was prior to my injury. I couldn’t recommend Jess highly enough and will forever be grateful for the hard work she put in throughout my rehabilitation.I came to see Jess after suffering an ACL rupture playing hockey which needed surgical intervention.

									<h3>Issy Morris - Welsh Triathlete</h3>
									<p>&quot;Jess has been fundamental in getting me as well prepared as possible on that start line. Whether it be flushing out my body pre-race, maintaining it in order to train consistently or providing advice and support on potential injury risks.  Jess has given me someone to wholeheartedly trust and confidence to push through a small niggle or take time off and recover when needed.  Jess has also contributed to my success by carrying out in depth flexibility and strength screening, and creating programmes to improve my range of motion, movement quality and strength.  I have seen long standing niggles and recurring injuries resolved through the combination of hands on treatment, flexibility, core stability and strength work which has in turn improved my robustness in sport. Thank you&quot;</p>

									<h3>Matthew Wright - Barbadian Triathlete</h3>
									<p>&quot;I’ve been working with Jess for just under a year now. She has been brilliant in nursing me back from an Achilles injury, and keeping me on top of the numerous niggle we tend to get training 25+ hours a week as triathletes. It’s not just about treating a problem with Jess, she works tirelessly at finding a solution. And the best thing is that she is willing to adapt and take on board things that have worked previously for me as an athlete. It is not just a &quot;my way or the highway approach&quot;. Can highly recommend&quot;</p>

									<h3>Iestyn Harrett - Welsh Commonwealth Games Relay Athlete</h3>
									<p>&quot;One of the key contributing factors to success for any athlete is to surround themselves with a performance team, be that a coach, physio, nutritionist, or simply a very supportive family member.  I have been fortunate that over the past two years Jess Parry-Williams has been a part of my performance team and played a pivotal role in helping me meet the demands of training and racing that are required as a professional triathlete.&quot;</p>

									<h3>Josh Lewis - Guernsey Triathlete</h3>
									<p>&quot;Jess has been very attentive, hard working and thorough throughout my time being treated by her.  She really went above and beyond during my holding camp for the Commonwealth Games in Australia to ensure that my niggles were being managed and resolved and my body was in the best shape possible in order to train on a daily basis and complete at the highest level.  I’d definitely recommend Jess if your looking for someone who truly has your best interests at heart.&quot;</p>
