									<h2><a href="#">What is Physiotherapy?</a></h2>
								</div>
								<p>Physiotherapists specialise in the assessment, diagnosis and treatment of injury or functional limitations and treat these through a variety of exercise and hands on physiotherapy treatment modalities.  Jess has 18 years of experience working within this field, has worked within A&E and Orthopaedics assessing and treating acute soft tissue and bone injuries, carrying out advanced rehabilitation back to full activity and sport within the NHS and also within Welsh Sport.</p>
								<p>Jess works closely with a team of skilled and experienced Consultants, should further investigations be required to aid diagnosis and rehabilitation.</p>

									<h2><a href="#">Physiotherapy Appointment</a></h2>
								</div>
								<p>Jess will spend time asking a series of questions about your health, previous injuries, current injuries, activity levels and your expectations of the assessment and treatment.  An in-depth assessment of the affected area and areas that may be influencing the affected area will be carried out to give a clear picture of the cause of the problem and other factors impacting on it.  Jess will discuss and create an individualised treatment plan for you with your goals in mind. This may include hands on manual therapy treatment, a rehabilitation exercise programme, advice, acupuncture, and strapping.</p>

								<p>&nbsp;</p>
								<div class="title">
									<h2><a href="#">What do I need to wear or bring with me?</a></h2>
								</div>
								<p>You are advised to wear comfortable clothing that allows you to move freely during your assessment and treatment.  Clothing that allows visibility and access to the affected area to be treated is advisable.  Your dignity and requests will be respected at all times during your physiotherapy appointment.</p>
